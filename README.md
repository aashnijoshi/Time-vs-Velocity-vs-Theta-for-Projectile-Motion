# TimevsVelocityvsThetaforProjectileMotion
This program plots a 3D plot for the Range, Initial Velocity and Angle of Horizon (theta) for a projectile. Projectile motion is a form of motion experienced by an object or particle (a projectile) that is projected near any celestia object's surface and moves along a curved path under the action of gravity only.  An interesting thing to note for this program is that you can plot this graph for any of the 8 planets, their moons, pluto and the sun simply by choosing a number at the start.
